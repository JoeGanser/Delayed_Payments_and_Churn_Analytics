    \section{Delayed Payments and Churn
Analytics}\label{delayed-payments-and-churn-analytics}

By Joe Ganser

    \subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\textbf{Introduction}}{Introduction}}\label{introduction}

Data on 6092 contracts (consisting of 3000 customers) across a time
spanning between January 1st 2013 to December 11th 2018 were studied.

Two objectives were to be met:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Analyze the late payment trends by region and year.
\item
  Examine what factors were involved in causing a customer to churn.
\end{itemize}

    \subsubsection{Data Description}\label{data-description}

The data itself was a joining of two sources: account records and
contract records. Accounts described each customer featuring columns
such as;

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The customer's geographic region
\item
  Whether or not they had a vendor partner involved.
\end{itemize}

Contracts described the deal, featuring columns such as * Date of deal
closure * The size of the deal (in thousands of ARR) * Length of the
deal (in years) * Date payment was received

    \subsubsection{Late Payments}\label{late-payments}

An issue that had been addressed was the payment delays. If a payment
was not made to an account within 45 days of closure, notices were sent
out. It was the task of this analysis to understand how this
notification process effected payment delays by each region, across the
years of 2017 to 2018.

So how did the notification process effect the promptness of payment?
Take a look at these three graphs;

    

    Clearly, the delayed payment rate is dropping. For each region, across
2017 to 2018, the amount of money paid late has dropped between 30-36\%
for 45 day delays, dropping 30\%-52\% for 90 day delays and dropping
50-100\% for 135 days (with the exception of two outliers).

    \subsubsection{Churning Customers}\label{churning-customers}

The length of the contract for each customer was measured in the units
of years. Because of this, an ``annual'' or ``quarterly'' churn rate
calculation would be inappropriate. Thus, the churn rate was calculated
across the entire interval of five years.

How were churning customers identified? If a customer churned, they only
had one contract, and therefore only one contract closure date
associated with their account. \emph{It was identified that out of 3000
accounts, 1069 churned making for a 35.63\% churn rate between
2013-2018}.

    \subsubsection{Factors effecting churn}\label{factors-effecting-churn}

It was determined that the \emph{region had no impact} as to whether or
not they churned. However, the important factors as to determining a
churning customer were; * If a partner was involved * The length of
contract (1,2 or 3 years) * The size of the contract in thousands ARR

These conclusions were made using statistical hypothesis testing and can
also be observed graphically. Considering the following graphs, the
hypothesis tests make sense:

    

    As you can see, the distribution of regions amongst churners versus
renewals is the same.

    

    The distributions of partner involvement of churners versus renewals are
clearly different.

    

    The distributions of contract length was significantly different between
churners versus renewals.

    

    Contract size distributions may be similar in shape, but the average
values differ significantly. (Churner average 118.39k ARR, renewal
average was 151.52k ARR).

    \subsubsection{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Churners tended to have longer contracts but smaller sizes
\item
  Churners had a partner involved more frequently than renewals.
\item
  Late payments are dropping by at least 30\% per region.
\end{itemize}
